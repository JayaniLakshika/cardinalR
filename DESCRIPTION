Description:
    A collection of simple simulation datasets designed for generating Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) representations using techniques such as tSNE, UMAP, PHATE, TriMAP, and PaCMAP. These datasets serve as a valuable resource for conducting experiments to better understand the reliability of NLDR representations in various contexts.
