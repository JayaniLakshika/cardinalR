Description:A collection of simple simulation datasets designed for
    generating Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) representations
    techniques such as tSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding),
    and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). These
    datasets serve as a valuable resource for understanding the
    reliability of NLDR representations in various contexts.
